# sk.in: Skin Infection Detection using Machine Learning

**iOS Versions Supported:** iOS 12.0 and above.

## Description

This is an iOS App created using a template from [CSML App Studio](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/csmlappstudio/detection) during the Science Internship Program 2022 at UCSC. 
 
sk.in uses object detection to identify skin conditions from five classes: bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, parasitic infections, and allergic reactions. Visit the [website](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/sk-in/home) for more specific information about the development of sk.in, for resources regarding skin treatment, for help using the app, and more. 

The current model converged with an approximate loss of 1 after 73,000 steps.
