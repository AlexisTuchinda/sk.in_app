# sk.in: Skin Infection Detection using Machine Learning

**iOS Versions Supported:** iOS 12.0 and above.

## Description

This is an iOS App created using a template from [CSML App Studio](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/csmlappstudio/detection) during the Science Internship Program 2022 at UCSC. 
 
sk.in uses object detection to identify skin conditions from five classes: bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, parasitic infections, and allergic reactions. Visit the [website](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/sk-in/home) for more specific information about the development of sk.in, for resources regarding skin treatment, for help using the app, and more. 

The model in this repo is not the latest. Waiting for current model to converge.
